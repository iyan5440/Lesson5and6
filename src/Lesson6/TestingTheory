Testing Theory
==============

Goals of testing:
1) Complete Code Coverage: Its impossible for every line in your code
to be executed in 1 run (ex: - if statements). The goal is to ensure
that every line gets run at least once. Requires several trials.
2) Efficiency: Testers want to avoid using test data that belongs to
the same "Equivalence Class". This is data that will send you down
the same path of execution each time you run the program.

Strategies:
1) Test around "boundary conditions". This is data that falls right
on or near boundaries. ex: - nUMBER MUST BE 10 - 20, SO TEST 9,10,11,
19,20,21
2) Test with "extreme conditions". This is data that is far from 
acceptable limits. EX: - test 1 million or - 1 million

boundaries:
try - 0,1,2,3
Rate - 6.74, 6.75, 30.50,30.51
hours - try -1, 0 ,1 ,59 ,60 ,61

Extreme:
Type - try -1000, +1000
Rate - -100 and +100
Hours - -100 and +100
